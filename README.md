This script implements a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The user inputs their choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors" (or "q" to quit), and the computer randomly selects its move. The script then determines the winner, updates the win counts, and prints the results. The game continues in a loop until the user decides to quit. Finally, it displays the total number of wins for both the user and the computer before exiting.
